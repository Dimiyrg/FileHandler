# File Handler
## Laboratory work No. 1, 1 semester, 2 course.
### Objective: to implement a file handler class.
### Class capabilities:
+ #### Reading from and writing to txt, xml, json files.
+ #### Reading from an encrypted and / or compressed file.
+ #### File recording with encryption and / or compression.
+ #### Processing arithmetic expressions in a file.
 Reading and writing with parameters (encryption / compression) is implemented using ***the Decorator*** pattern. Implement the creation of objects using ***the Builder*** and ***the Singleton*** pattern. Search and process arithmetic expressions using ***RegExp***. Write unit tests for all classes using ***JUnit***. Implement the rest of the classes at your own discretion.
